v0.3.0 (SVN r111)
-------
fixes:
- fine tuned the "#ifdef LOG4NET" statements (thanks to prencher for noticing this
  log4net is fully optional! (only required for debugging the library)
- fixed bug, the class changed the Op and Voice list of a copy *boing*
  (FxCop pointed me to it)
- added check for "~" userflag on nameslist (thanks to Giacomo Di Ciocco)
  this broke the library on IRC networks using that userflag on channels
- fixed channel sync bug, when the connection is re-established
  (Closes sf.net bug #1043536)
- fixed rejoining channels when using Reconnect()
- added sanity checks in _Event_WHOREPLY()
  this will prevent exceptions when the IRC server voilates the RFC    
  (like some psybnc version do)
- fixed string handling in _Event_PRIVMSG() for CTCP messages
  (Closes sf.net bug #1039286)

changes:
- making SmartIrc4net CLS and .NET standards conform
  changed all delegates to use EventArgs
- made a few constructors "internal"
- directory struture changed
  the structure now represents the API layers
  (IrcConnection, IrcCommands and IrcClient)
- regex optimizations (thanks to prencher for the hints)
- renamed all ReplyCodes to conform to .NET standards
  (e.g. ReyplCode.RPL_Welcome -> ReplyCode.Welcome)
- renamed IrcConnection.Version to IrcConnection.VersionNumber
- renamed ChannelSync to ActiveChannelSync
  later I will introduce PassiveChannelSync, this means only the received
  data is used for channel sync no extra commands are send to the IRC server.

new:
- parts of SmartIrc4net have now XML documentation tags
- added *EventArgs for the events
- added exception handling for Connect() Reconnect() Disconnect()
- added VisualStudio project files (thanks to prencher for creating them)
- added constructors to the exception classes (.NET standards)
- added log calls for queue, when data could not be sent and is requeued
- added missing overloads for RFC commands (Closes sf.net bug #1061503)
  (Join, Part, Kick, List, Names) 
- added more RFC commands, now all RFC 2812 commands are implemented!
  (Oper, Motd, Luser, Version, Stats, Service, Squit, Links, Time, Connect,
   Trace, Admin, Info, Servlist, Squery, Whois, Whowas, Kill, Ping, Pong,
   Away, Rehash, Die, Restart, Summon, Users, Wallops, Userhost, Ison)
- WriteLine() will throw an NotConnectedException now when it's used without
  having a connection to an IRC server
- added timeout values for the tcp socket (6 minutes), and activated nodelay flag
- prefixed all IrcCommands that are actually plain RFC commands with "Rfc"
  e.g. Join() is now called RfcJoin()
